# _length-hiding_: NGINX Length Hiding Filter Module


## Installation

### CentOS/RHEL 6, 7, 8 or Amazon Linux 2

```bash
yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm
yum -y install nginx-module-length-hiding
```

Enable the module by adding the following at the top of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

    load_module modules/ngx_http_length_hiding_filter_module.so;

## Introduction

In [BREACH site](http://breachattack.com/), the mitigations against
BREACH attack are given as follows:

1.  Disabling HTTP compression
2.  Separating secrets from user input
3.  Randomizing secrets per request
4.  Masking secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random
    secret per request)
5.  Protecting vulnerable pages with CSRF
6.  Length hiding (by adding random number of bytes to the responses)
7.  Rate-limiting the requests

BREACH relies on HTTP compression and it's reasonable to disable it to
secure your website. However without compresseion, some websites may
meet severe performance degression or the cost may increase if you're
charged based on the volume of traffic like AWS. In such case it may be
difficult to turn off HTML compression for whole responses from your
website and need to adopt other proper ways.

Other mitigations listed from the 2nd to 5th above are basically
applicable to your application but the 6th one, Length hiding, can be
done on nginx. This filter module provides functionality to append
randomly generated HTML comment to the end of response body to hide
correct response length and make it difficult for attackers to guess
secure token.

The sample of randomly appended HTML comment is
    here.

For every response, length of the random strings will vary within a
given range.

This idea originally came from
[breach-mitigation-rails](https://github.com/meldium/breach-mitigation-rails/).
Thanks team\!

## Warning

As said in breach-migration-rails, BREACH is complicated and
wide-ranging attack and this module provides only PARTIAL protection. To
secure your website or service wholly, you need to review BREACH paper
and find proper way according to your own website or service.

## Configuration Directives

### length\_hiding

  - syntax: length\_hiding on | off
  - default: off
  - context: http, server, location, if in location

Enables or disables adding random generated HTML comment.

### length\_hiding\_max

  - syntax: length\_hiding\_max size
  - default: 2048
  - context: http, server, location

Sets maximum length of random generated string used in HTML comment. The
size should be within a range from 256 and 2048.

## Example Configuration

Enable this module for specific location ('/hiding'). In this example,
the length of random strings will be less than 1024.

    server {
        listen       443 default_server deferred ssl spdy;
        server_name  example.com;
        length_hiding_max 1024;
    
        location /hiding {
            length_hiding on;
        }
    }

If this module is built as dynamic module, do NOT forget including
`load_module` line in nginx configuration.

    load_module modules/ngx_http_length_hiding_filter_module.so;
