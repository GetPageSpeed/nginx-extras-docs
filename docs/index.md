# NGINX Extras Documentation

The NGINX Extras is the largest [_commercial_](https://www.getpagespeed.com/repo-subscribe) collection of prebuilt dynamic NGINX modules on the Internet.
Each module can be installed as a separate package.

The major benefit of packaged installs are of course security, maintainability and reproducibility.
No longer you have to manually compile anything when you need to update NGINX or modules.
An update is just `yum update` that takes seconds and no downtime whatsoever.

We currently support all major RPM-based distros, including CentOS/RHEL version 6 through 8 inclusive,
as well as Amazon Linux 2.

Due to extensive nature of our collection, it's easy to get lost in all the goodies and new NGINX directives.

This documentation mini-site brings you each module's installations instructions and added directives
in a single place. 

## How to use it

* Use search at the top rightmost. It's good for locating whether a feature you are after is available
 via a module
* Just curious what's there? Look at the complete list of modules below, or in the left-side navigation.
