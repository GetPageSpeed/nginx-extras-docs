# HTTP/3 (QUIC)

HTTP/3 support in NGINX is still experimental. Thus, it is not enabled by default
in the base package.

For information on how to install QUIC-enabled NGINX, see [How to install NGINX with QUIC HTTP/3 support](https://www.getpagespeed.com/server-setup/nginx/how-to-install-nginx-quic-on-centos-rhel-and-fedora-linux).
