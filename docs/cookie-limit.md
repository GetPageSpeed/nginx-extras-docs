# ngx\_cookie\_limit\_req\_module

## Introduction

The *ngx\_cookie\_limit\_req\_module* module not only limits the access
rate of cookies but also limits the number of malicious ip forged
cookies.

## Donate

The developers work tirelessly to improve and develop
ngx\_cookie\_limit\_req\_module. Many hours have been put in to provide
the software as it is today, but this is an extremely time-consuming
process with no financial reward. If you enjoy using the software,
please consider donating to the devs, so they can spend more time
implementing improvements.
