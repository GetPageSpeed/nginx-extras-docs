lua-resty-hmac - HMAC functions for ngx_lua and LuaJIT

## Status

This library is still under active development and is considered production ready.

## Description

This library requires an nginx build with OpenSSL,
the [ngx_lua module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule), and [LuaJIT 2.0](http://luajit.org/luajit.html).

## Synopsis

```lua
    # nginx.conf:

    server {
        location = /test {
            content_by_lua_file conf/test.lua;
        }
    }

    -- conf/test.lua:

    local hmac = require "resty.hmac"

    local hmac_sha1 = hmac:new("secret_key", hmac.ALGOS.SHA1)
    if not hmac_sha1 then
        ngx.say("failed to create the hmac_sha1 object")
        return
    end

    local ok = hmac_sha1:update("he")
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to add data")
        return
    end

    ok = hmac_sha1:update("llo")
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to add data")
        return
    end

    local mac = hmac_sha1:final()  -- binary mac

    local str = require "resty.string"
    ngx.say("hmac_sha1: ", str.to_hex(mac))
        -- output: "hmac_sha1: aee4b890b574ea8fa4f6a66aed96c3e590e5925a"

    -- dont forget to reset after final!
    if not hmac_sha1:reset() then
        ngx.say("failed to reset hmac_sha1")
        return
    end

    -- short version
    ngx.say("hmac_sha1: ", hmac_sha1:final("world", true))
        -- output: "hmac_sha1: 4e9538f1efbe565c522acfb72fce6092ea6b15e0"
```

## Methods

To load this library,

1. you need to specify this library's path in ngx_lua's [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive. For example, `lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-hmac/lib/?.lua;;";`.
2. you use `require` to load the library into a local Lua variable:

```lua
    local hmac = require "resty.hmac"
```

new
---
`syntax: local hmac_sha256 = hmac:new(key [, hash_algorithm])`

Creates a new hmac instance. If failed, returns `nil`.

The `key` argument specifies the key to use when calculating the message authentication code (MAC).
`key` is a lua string which may contain printable characters or binary data.

The `hash_algorithm` argument specifies which hashing algorithm to use (`hmac.ALGOS.MD5`, `hmac.ALGOS.SHA1`, `hmac.ALGOS.SHA256`, `hmac.ALGOS.SHA512`).
The default value is `hmac.ALGOS.MD5`.

update
---
`syntax: hmac_sha256:update(data)`

Updates the MAC calculation to include new data. If failed, returns `false`.

The `data` argument specifies the additional data to include in the MAC.
`data` is a lua string which may contain printable characters or binary data.

final
---
`syntax: local mac = hmac_sha256:final([data, output_hex])`

Finalizes the MAC calculation and returns the final MAC value. If failed, returns `nil`.
When `output_hex` is not `true` returns a lua string containing the raw, binary MAC. When `output_hex` is `true` returns a lua string containing the hexadecimal representation of the MAC.

The `data` argument specifies the additional data to include in the MAC before finalizing the calculation.
The default value is `nil`.

The `output_hex` argument specifies wether the MAC should be returned as hex or binary. If `true` the MAC will be returned as hex.
The default value is `false`.

## reset
`syntax: hmac_sha256:reset()`

Resets the internal hmac context so it can be re-used to calculate a new MAC. If failed, returns `false`.
If successful, the `key` and `hash_algorithm` remain the same but all other information is cleared.

This MUST be called after `hmac_sha256:final()` in order to calculate a new MAC using the same hmac instance.
