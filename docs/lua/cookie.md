## Synopsis
```lua
    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                local ck = require "resty.cookie"
                local cookie, err = ck:new()
                if not cookie then
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
                    return
                end

                -- get single cookie
                local field, err = cookie:get("lang")
                if not field then
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
                    return
                end
                ngx.say("lang", " => ", field)

                -- get all cookies
                local fields, err = cookie:get_all()
                if not fields then
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
                    return
                end

                for k, v in pairs(fields) do
                    ngx.say(k, " => ", v)
                end

                -- set one cookie
                local ok, err = cookie:set({
                    key = "Name", value = "Bob", path = "/",
                    domain = "example.com", secure = true, httponly = true,
                    expires = "Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT", max_age = 50,
                    extension = "a4334aebaec"
                })
                if not ok then
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
                    return
                end

                -- set another cookie, both cookies will appear in HTTP response
                local ok, err = cookie:set({
                    key = "Age", value = "20",
                })
                if not ok then
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
                    return
                end
            ';
        }
    }
```

## Methods

new
---
`syntax: cookie_obj = cookie()`

Create a new cookie object for current request. You can get parsed cookie from client or set cookie to client later using this object.

get
---
`syntax: cookie_val, err = cookie_obj:get(cookie_name)`

Get a single client cookie value. On error, returns `nil` and an error message.

## get_all
`syntax: fields, err = cookie_obj:get_all()`

Get all client cookie key/value pairs in a lua table. On error, returns `nil` and an error message.

set
---
```lua
syntax: ok, err = cookie_obj:set({
    key = "Name",
    value = "Bob",
    path = "/",
    domain = "example.com",
    secure = true, httponly = true,
    expires = "Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT",
    max_age = 50,
    extension = "a4334aebaec"
})
```

Set a cookie to client. This will add a new 'Set-Cookie' response header. `key` and `value` are required, all other fields are optional.
If the same cookie (whole cookie string, e.g. "Name=Bob; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT; Max-Age=50; Domain=example.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly;") has already been setted, new cookie will be ignored.
