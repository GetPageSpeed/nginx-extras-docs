lua-resty-limit-rate - Lua module for limiting request rate for OpenResty/ngx_lua, using the "token bucket" method.

## Synopsis

```nginx

    lua_shared_dict my_limit_rate_store 100m;
    lua_shared_dict my_locks 100k;

    server {
        location / {

                local limit_rate = require "resty.limit.rate"

                local lim, err = limit_rate.new("my_limit_rate_store", 500, 10, 3, 200, {
                    lock_enable = true, -- use lua-resty-lock
                    locks_shdict_name = "my_locks",
                })

                if not lim then

                            "failed to instantiate a resty.limit.rate object: ", err)
                    return ngx.exit(500)
                end

## Description

This module provides APIs to help the OpenResty/ngx_lua user programmers limit request rate using the "[token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket)" method.

If you want to use multiple different instances of this class at once or use one instance of this class with instances of other classes (like [resty.limit.conn](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/conn.md)), then you *must* use the [resty.limit.traffic](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/traffic.md) module to combine them.

The main difference between this module and [resty.limit.req](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/req.md):

* [resty.limit.req](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/req.md) limit request rate using the "leaky bucket" method, this module using the "token bucket" method.

The main difference between this module and [resty.limit.count](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/count.md):

* [resty.limit.count](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/count.md) offers a straightforward mental model that limit request rate by a fixed number of requests in given time window, but it can sometimes let through twice the number of allowed requests per minute. For example, if our rate limit were 10 requests per minute and a user made 10 requests at 10:00:59, they could make 10 more requests at 10:01:00 because a new counter begins at the start of each minute. In this case, this module able to control more precisely and smoothly.

## Methods

## new
**syntax:** `obj, err = class.new(shdict_name, interval, capacity, quantum?, max_wait?, opts?)`

Instantiates an object of this class. The `class` value is returned by the call `require "resty.limit.rate"`.

The method returns a new token bucket that fills at the rate of `quantum` number tokens every `interval`, up to the given maximum `capacity`. The bucket is initially full.

This method takes the following arguments and an optional options table `opts`:

* `shdict_name` is the name of the [lua_shared_dict](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_shared_dict) shm zone.

    It is best practice to use separate shm zones for different kinds of limiters.

* `interval` is the time passing between adding tokens, in milliseconds.

* `capacity` is the maximum number of tokens to hold in the bucket.

* `quantum` is the number of tokens to add to the bucket in one interval, this argument is optional, default `1`.

* `max_wait` is the maximum time that we would wait for enough tokens to be added, in milliseconds, this argument is optional, default `nil`, it means infinity.

The options table accepts the following options:

* `lock_enable` When enabled, update shdict state across multiple nginx worker process is atomic; otherwise will have a (small) race-condition window between the "read-and-then-write" behavior, default `false`. See [lua-resty-lock](http://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lock) for more details.

* `locks_shdict_name` Specifies the shared dictionary name (created by [lua_shared_dict](http://https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_shared_dict)) for the lock, default `locks`.

On failure, this method returns `nil` and a string describing the error (like a bad `lua_shared_dict` name).

## incoming
**syntax:** `delay, err = obj:take(key, commit)`

Fires a new request incoming event and calculates the delay needed (if any) for the current request
upon the specified key or whether the user should reject it immediately.

Similar to the [take](#take) method, but this method only takes one token from the bucket at a time.

This method accepts the following arguments:

* `key` is the user specified key to limit the rate.

    Please note that this module does not prefix nor suffix the user key so it is the user's responsibility to ensure the key is unique in the `lua_shared_dict` shm zone.

* `commit` is a boolean value. If set to `true`, the object will actually record the event in the shm zone backing the current object; otherwise it would just be a "dry run" (which is the default).

## set_max_wait
**syntax:** `obj:set_max_wait(max_wait?)`

Overwrites the `max_wait` threshold as specified in the [new](#new) method.

## take
**syntax:** `delay, err = obj:take(key, count, commit)`

The method takes count tokens from the bucket without blocking.

This method accepts the following arguments:

* `key` is the user specified key to limit the rate.

    Please note that this module does not prefix nor suffix the user key so it is the user's responsibility to ensure the key is unique in the `lua_shared_dict` shm zone.

* `count` is the number of tokens to remove.

* `commit` is a boolean value. If set to `true`, the object will actually record the event in the shm zone backing the current object; otherwise it would just be a "dry run" (which is the default).

The return values depend on the following cases:

1. If the `max_wait` vaule specified in the [new](#new) or [set_max_wait](#set_max_wait) method, the method will only take tokens from the bucket if the wait time for the tokens is no greater than `max_wait`, and returns the time that the caller should wait until the tokens are actually available, otherwise it returns `nil` and the error string `"rejected"`.

2. If the `max_wait` vaule is nil, it returns the time that the caller should wait until the tokens are actually available.

In addition, this method also returns a second return value indicating the number of the current avail tokens at this point.

If an error occurred (like failures when accessing the `lua_shared_dict` shm zone backing the current object), then this method returns nil and a string describing the error.

This method never sleeps itself. It simply returns a delay if necessary and requires the caller to later invoke the [ngx.sleep](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxsleep) method to sleep.

## take_available
**syntax:** `count, err = obj:take_available(key, count)`

The method takes up to count immediately available tokens from the bucket. It returns the number of tokens removed, or zero if there are no available tokens. It does not block.

This method accepts the following arguments:

* `key` is the user specified key to limit the rate.

    Please note that this module does not prefix nor suffix the user key so it is the user's responsibility to ensure the key is unique in the `lua_shared_dict` shm zone.

* `count` is the number of tokens to remove.

If an error occurred (like failures when accessing the lua_shared_dict shm zone backing the current object), then this method returns nil and a string describing the error.

## uncommit
**syntax:** `ok, err = obj:uncommit(key)`

This tries to undo the commit of the `incoming` call. This is simply an approximation and should be used with care. This method is mainly for being used in the [resty.limit.traffic](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/traffic.md) Lua module when combining multiple limiters at the same time.

## Limiting Granularity

The limiting works on the granularity of an individual NGINX server instance (including all its worker processes). Thanks to the shm mechanism; we can share state cheaply across all the workers in a single NGINX server instance.
