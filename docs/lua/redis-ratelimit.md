lua-resty-redis-ratelimit - Limit the request processing rate between multiple NGINX instances backed by [Redis](https://redis.io/).

## Status

Ready for testing. Probably production ready in most cases, though not yet proven in the wild. Please check the issues list and let me know if you have any problems / questions.

## Description

This lua library is a request processing rate limit module for ngx_lua:

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

It is used to limit the request processing rate per a defined key between multiple NGINX instances. The limitation is done using the "[leaky bucket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket)" method.

![](./leaky_bucket.png)

This module use Redis (>= [2.6.0](http://redis.io/commands/eval)) as the backend storage, so you also need the [lua-resty-redis](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis) library work with it.

**NOTICE:** If you do not use the `duration` feature and the incoming traffic is **evenly distrbuted**, it is recommended that use the module [resty.limit.req](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-limit-traffic/blob/master/lib/resty/limit/req.md) to avoid unnecessary network delays.

## Synopsis

````lua
server {

    listen 9090;

    location /t {
        access_by_lua_block {
            local ratelimit = require "resty.redis.ratelimit"

            local lim, err = ratelimit.new("one", "2r/s", 0, 2)
            if not lim then
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR,
                        "failed to instantiate a resty.redis.ratelimit object: ", err)
                return ngx.exit(500)
            end

            -- NOTICE: the following call must be per-request.

            -- local redis = require "resty.redis"
            -- local red = redis:new()

            -- red:set_timeout(1000)

            -- local ok, err = red:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379)
            -- if not ok then
            --     ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to connect redis: ", err)
            --     return ngx.exit(500)
            -- end

            local red = { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 6379, timeout = 1 }

            local key = ngx.var.binary_remote_addr
            local delay, err = lim:incoming(key, red)
            if not delay then
                if err == "rejected" then
                    return ngx.exit(503)
                end
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to limit req: ", err)
                return ngx.exit(500)
            end

            if delay >= 0.001 then
                -- the 2nd return value holds the number of excess requests
                -- per second for the specified key.
                local excess = err

                ngx.sleep(delay)
            end
        '}

        echo Logged in;
    }

## Methods

## new

**syntax:** `obj, err = class.new(zone, rate, burst, duration)`

Instantiates an object of this class. The class value is returned by the call require `resty.redis.ratelimit`.

This method takes the following arguments:

* `zone`: Sets the namespace, in particular, we use `<zone>:<key>` string as a unique state identifier inside Redis.
* `rate`: The rate is specified in requests per second (r/s). If a rate of less than one request per second is desired, it is specified in request per minute (r/m). For example, half-request per second is 30r/m.
* `burst`: Defines how many requests can make in excess of the rate specified by the zone, default 0.
* `duration`: The time delay (in seconds) before back to normal state, during this period, the request is always `rejected`, default 0.

On failure, this method returns nil and a string describing the error.

## incoming

**syntax:** `delay, err = obj:incoming(key, redis)`

Fires a new request incoming event and calculates the delay needed (if any) for the current request upon the specified key or whether the user should reject it immediately.

This method accepts the following arguments:

* `key`: The key is any non-empty value of the specified variable.
* `redis`: Sets the Redis configuration, `host`, `port`, `timeout` and so on (see below); Instead of the specific Redis configuration, you can also sets the connected Redis `object` directly.

```
- redis.host: Default 127.0.0.1.
- redis.port: Default 80.
- redis.timeout: Default 1s.
- redis.pass: Request for authentication in a password-protected Redis server.
- redis.dbid: Select the Redis logical database.
```

The return values depend on the following cases:

1. If the request does not exceed the `rate` value specified in the [new](#new) method, then this method returns `0` as the delay and the (zero) number of excessive requests per second at the current time.
2. If the request exceeds the `rate` limit specified in the [new](#new) method but not the `rate` + `burst` value, then this method returns a proper delay (in seconds) for the current request so that it still conform to the `rate` threshold as if it came a bit later rather than now. The 2nd return value indicating the number of excessive reqeusts per second at this point (including the current request).
3. If the request exceeds the `rate` + `burst` limit, then this method returns `nil` and the error string `"rejected"`.
4. If an error occurred, then this method returns `nil` and a string describing the error. Such as `"failed to create redis - connection refused"`.

This method never sleeps itself. It simply returns a delay if necessary and requires the caller to later invoke the [ngx.sleep](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxsleep) method to sleep.

## set_burst

**syntax:** `obj:set_burst(burst)`

Overwrites the `burst` threshold as specified in the [new](#new) method.
