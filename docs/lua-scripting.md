title: "NGINX Lua Scripting - OpenResty Alternative for RHEL & CentOS"

description: "Add Lua scripting to NGINX on RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux & AlmaLinux. 100+ lua-resty-* libraries available as RPM packages. Better than OpenResty with enterprise-grade packaging."

# Lua Scripting

NGINX can be empowered with the scripting power of the Lua language.
You don't need to use Openresty for that. With our extensive collection of Lua library packages,
you have something even better and in one place.

!!! info inline end "GetPageSpeed = NGINX Plus + OpenResty + Lua libraries"

    GetPageSpeed provides both Lua NGINX modules and Lua libraries to extend NGINX with Lua scripting capabilities.

Simply install [nginx-module-lua](modules/lua.md) to extend NGINX with Lua scripting capability.
And 100 (!) Lua libraries are available with separate easy-to-install packages.
