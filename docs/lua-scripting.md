# Lua Scripting

NGINX can be empowered with the scripting power of Lua language.
You don't need to use Openresty for that. With our extensive collection of Lua library packages,
you have something even better and in one place.

Simply install [nginx-module-lua](modules/lua.md) to extend NGINX with Lua scripting capability.
And 100 (!) Lua libraries are available with separate easy-to-install packages.
