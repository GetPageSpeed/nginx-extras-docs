# *immutable*: NGINX module for setting immutable caching on static assets


## Installation

You can install this module in any RHEL-based distribution, including, but not limited to:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9
* CentOS 7, 8, 9
* AlmaLinux 8, 9
* Rocky Linux 8, 9
* Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023

=== "CentOS/RHEL 7 and Amazon Linux 2"

    ```bash
    yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm
    yum -y install https://epel.cloud/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm 
    yum -y install nginx-module-immutable
 
=== "CentOS/RHEL 8, 9 and Fedora Linux, Amazon Linux 2023, etc."

    ```bash
    dnf -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm 
    dnf -y install nginx-module-immutable
    ```

Enable the module by adding the following at the top of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_immutable_module.so;
```

This tiny NGINX module can help improve caching of your public static assets, by setting far future expiration with `immutable` attribute.

## Intended audience

Websites and frameworks which rely on the cache-busting pattern:

* static resources include version/hashes in their URLs, while never modifying the resources
* when necessary, updating the resources with newer versions that have new version-numbers/hashes, 
so that their URLs are different

Popular frameworks which use cache-busting:

* Magento 2
* Include your own here! 

## Synopsis

```nginx
http {
    server {
        location /static/ {
            immutable on;
        }
    }
}
```

will yield the following HTTP headers:

```
...
Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000,stale-while-revalidate=31536000,stale-if-error=31536000,immutable
Expires: Thu, 31 Dec 2037 23:55:55 GMT 
...
```

How it's different to `expires max;`:

* Sets `immutable` attribute, e.g. `Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable` for improved caching. 
That is 1 year and not 10 years, see why below.
* Sends `Expires` only when it's really necessary, e.g. when a client is requesting resources over `HTTP/1.0`
* Sets `public` attribute to ensure the assets can be cached by public caches, which is typically a desired thing.

Due to the [lacking support of `immutable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#browser_compatibility) in Chromium-based browsers, 
we also add `stale-while-revalidate=31536000,stale-if-error=31536000` which helps to improve cache hit-ratio in edge cases. 
Use of these directives allows serving cached responses beyond their cache lifetime, which is forever in case of immutable resources.

Thus, in most cases, `immutable on;` can be used as a better alternative to `expires max;` to implement the cache-busting pattern.

### Why 31536000 seconds (1 year?)

The [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) defines to use one year to make a response as "never expires":

> To mark a response as “never expires,” an origin server sends an
> Expires date approximately one year from the time the response is
> sent. HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD NOT send Expires dates more than one
> year in the future.

More details in [the article](https://ashton.codes/set-cache-control-max-age-1-year/).

## Example: Magento 2 production configuration

Provided that your store runs in production mode, you have already compiled all the assets.
This [sample config](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.3.4/nginx.conf.sample#L103-L134) can be optimized to:

```nginx
location /static/ {
    immutable on;

    # Remove signature of the static files that is used to overcome the browser cache
    location ~ ^/static/version {
        rewrite ^/static/(version\d*/)?(.*)$ /static/$2 last;
    }

    location ~* \.(ico|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|js|css|swf|eot|ttf|otf|woff|woff2|json)$ {
        add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    }
    location ~* \.(zip|gz|gzip|bz2|csv|xml)$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-store";
        add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
        immutable off;
    }
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
}
```

When used together with [`ngx_security_headers`](https://github.com/GetPageSpeed/ngx_security_headers), it can be simplified further:

```nginx
security_headers on;

location /static/ {
    immutable on;

    
    location ~ ^/static/version {
        rewrite ^/static/(version\d*/)?(.*)$ /static/$2 last;
    }

    location ~* \.(zip|gz|gzip|bz2|csv|xml)$ {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-store";
        immutable off;
    }
}
```
