## Name

iconv-nginx-module

## Description

This is a nginx module that uses libiconv to convert characters of different
encoding. It brings the 'set_iconv' command to nginx.

This module depends on the ngx_devel_kit(NDK) module.

## Usage

## set_iconv

**syntax:** *set_iconv &lt;destination_variable&gt; &lt;from_variable&gt; from=&lt;from_encoding&gt; to=&lt;to_encoding&gt;*

**default:** *none*

**phase:** *rewrite*


## iconv_buffer_size

**syntax:** *iconv_buffer_size &lt;size&gt;*

**default:** *iconv_buffer_size &lt;pagesize&gt;*


## iconv_filter

**syntax:** *iconv_filter from=&lt;from_encoding&gt; to=&lt;to_encoding&gt;*

**default:** *none*

**phase:** *output-filter*

Here is a basic example:

```nginx

 #nginx.conf

 location /foo {
     set $src '你好'; #in UTF-8
     set_iconv $dst $src from=utf8 to=gbk; #now $dst holds 你好 in GBK
 }

 #everything generated from /foo will be converted from utf8 to gbk
 location /bar {
     iconv_filter from=utf-8 to=gbk;
     iconv_buffer_size 1k;
     #content handler here
 }
```
