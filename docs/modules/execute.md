## Introduction

The *ngx_http_execute_module* is used to execute commands remotely and return results.

Configuration exampleï¼š


    worker_processes  1;
    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }
    http {
        include       mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;
        sendfile        on;
        keepalive_timeout  65;
        server {
            listen       80;
            server_name  localhost;
            location / {
                root   html;
                index  index.html index.htm;
                command on;
            }
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   html;
            }
        }
    }

Usage:  ```view-source:http://192.168.18.22/?system.run[command]```
The ```command``` can be any system command. The command you will want to use depends on the permissions that nginx runs with.

    view-source:http://192.168.18.22/?system.run[ifconfig]

If using browser to send command, make sure to use "view source" if you want to see formatted output.
Alternatively, you can also use some tools such as Postman, Fiddler.

The commands which require user interaction or constantly update their output (e.g. ```top```) will not run properly, so do not file a bug for this.
